Machine Learning Project - Natural Language Classifier

Objectives:
    Build a machine learning project which combines a simple classifier with a language model
    Understand how to use a pre-trained language model in a machine learning project
    Create a professional, production-ready machine learning application
    
Overview
Summary:
    Choose a real-world dataset from a curated list
    Ingest and store that data reliably, using a local script which will form the basis for an AWS Lambda with RDS
    Train a model on that data to understand or generate insights
    Create a chatbot interface that uses your trained model
    Add RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) functionality using simple local files
